AWorld is a multi-tenant SaaS platform that provides different APIs across three main contexts: App, Dashboard, and Portal. The platform uses Cognito with a custom domain for authentication and follows the OAuth2 protocol for user authorization.

## Key Concepts

- **Account**: Represents a tenant in the multi-tenant setup
- **Workspace**: Each account can have multiple workspaces (e.g., development, staging, production)
- **Principal**: A platform-level user
- **User**: A workspace-level user
