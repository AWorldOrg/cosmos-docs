The new product represents a strategic transformation of the AWorld model, aiming to offer companies a *gamification* system that is fully integrable into their digital ecosystems. Unlike the original solution, which provides an *end-to-end* experience within a single platform, this evolution allows clients to directly access AWorld’s *engagement* tools and adapt them to their specific needs.

## 2.1 A new infrastructure

Adopting an *API-first* architecture means turning *gamification* into a modular and scalable service, easily integrable into existing applications, websites, and enterprise systems, without infrastructure constraints. This approach ensures greater scalability and flexibility, allowing organizations to leverage the platform’s potential without needing to develop complex internal systems for *engagement* management.

In this new setup, the product acts as an application *layer* that enhances the user experience through structured tools to incentivize participation, measure engagement, and personalize interaction paths. Clients can configure their own digital environments by integrating game mechanics, interactive content, and experiential journeys—without compromising their brand identity or strategic goals.

To support this transition, AWorld has built its software on a modular architecture organized into four main layers, allowing companies to independently integrate *gamification* elements in a scalable manner while ensuring maximum operational flexibility. Each *layer* has a specific function:

### **2.1.1 Account & User Layer**

The platform’s foundation, responsible for managing users, permissions, and authentication. This component ensures a scalable infrastructure, allowing multiple organizations to use the service while maintaining proper data separation and customization. It includes tools such as *JWT management* and *Server-to-Server management*, which are essential for integration with clients’ existing systems.

### **2.1.2 Gamification Layer**

The core of the *engagement* system, providing the essential game mechanics. It includes features such as activities, missions, level progression, *leaderboards*, points system, *achievements*, and notifications. This layer enables companies to tailor the user experience by introducing competition and reward dynamics aligned with their goals.

> AWorld’s *gamification* system is built on a core principle: **the user must be able to perform a meaningful action**, which becomes the driver of their engagement. This action, called a ***Tractable Digital Activity (TDA)***, represents any trackable activity that can be used to trigger game dynamics.

In the new system, the client is free to define what constitutes a **TDA**, adapting it to their context: an **activity** could consist of *publishing a post*, *reading a piece of content*, *scanning a QR code*, *completing a quiz*, or any other digitally monitorable interaction.

Each **TDA** fuels the system, contributing to point accumulation, mission progress, and reward triggers—turning user actions into a measurable and personalized engagement journey.

### **2.1.2 Activity Plugin Layer**

This layer enables and provides access to **predefined activity models**, developed and validated by AWorld through its mobile app experience. While every client can define their own custom **Tractable Digital Activities (TDAs)**, AWorld offers a set of **optimized activity models** that can be used immediately to speed up *gamification* implementation.

Among these, **Stories** engage users through interactive content, while **Quizzes** provide multiple-choice questions to stimulate learning and engagement. **Routines** are recurring action sequences that users must complete over time.

Additionally, the system includes models based on mobility and wellness data, such as **Mobility Milestones**, which track sustainable mobility behaviors, and **Wellness Milestones**, which monitor steps and minutes of physical activity. These are only available if the user’s touchpoint is a **mobile device**, allowing integration with smartphone sensors or data from health-tracking apps.

Thanks to the *Activity Plugin Layer*, clients can **combine their own activities with AWorld’s proven solutions**, accelerating *gamification* deployment while ensuring an effective and engaging user experience from day one.

### **2.1.3 Catalog Layer**

The *Catalog Layer* manages the organization and distribution of content available on the platform, offering clients access to AWorld’s predefined resources or the ability to customize their own activities.

Although clients can configure their own **TDAs**, AWorld provides a structured catalog of **validated content**, enabling faster *gamification* deployment. For instance, a client adopting the **Stories** model can either create their own content or select from AWorld’s **Stories** catalog, which offers a curated collection of articles and ready-to-use materials. The same applies to **Quizzes**, which come with a bank of questions and interactive tests, and to **Missions**, with pre-built challenges based on years of platform experience.

This layer not only speeds up *gamification* integration but also ensures high-quality activities, providing a solid starting point for clients who want to quickly launch engaging experiences.

Adopting this new layered architecture improves the platform’s technical efficiency and opens up new growth opportunities for AWorld by broadening its target audience and enabling entry into new market segments.

### **2.1.4 *AI Content Generation*: support for creating interactive *Stories***

Many AWorld clients want to personalize the platform but often face an **operational barrier: content creation requires time and specific expertise**. To address this challenge, AWorld is experimenting with AI integration to **support the creation of interactive content**, starting with the **Stories** activity model. Experience has shown that while many clients want to customize the platform, they often **lack the time or resources** to produce quality content independently.

For this reason, AWorld is developing a system that, through AI, will **assist clients in gen**
