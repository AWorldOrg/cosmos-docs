A digital platform wants to build an active community where users create content, participate in challenges, and form a self-sustaining engagement ecosystem.

### Content setup

**Custom activities** track community contributions: posting content, commenting, sharing, inviting new members, and attending virtual events. Each action type is registered as a distinct activity, enabling granular tracking and differentiated rewards.

Short **Learning Paths** serve as community onboarding — introducing new members to guidelines, features, and culture. **Weekly quizzes** on community-related topics provide a recurring engagement touchpoint.

### Engagement mechanics

A diverse set of **missions** drives different types of participation:

- Individual missions: "Publish 10 posts this week" or "Invite 3 friends."
- **Group missions** for collective challenges: "Together, reach 1,000 contributions this month." These use tag-based group targeting to create team-level goals.

The community runs on **two virtual currencies**:

- **Reputation**: a non-spendable currency that accumulates based on contributions and drives leaderboard rankings. Reputation reflects a member's standing in the community.
- **Coins**: earned through mission completion and spendable on exclusive badges, profile customizations, or premium features.

**Reward rules** assign reputation based on contribution quality — a post that generates engagement earns more reputation than a simple comment — while coins are tied to mission completion.

### Competitive layer

A **global leaderboard ranked by reputation** showcases the community's most valued contributors. **Weekly challenge leaderboards** create focused bursts of activity around specific themes or events.

A **daily streak** rewards members who contribute to the community every day. The **freeze mechanism** — costing coins — lets members preserve their streak during breaks, creating a meaningful choice between spending coins on cosmetics or on streak protection.

### Measurement

Community health is tracked through:

- **DAU/MAU ratio**: daily and monthly active users reveal engagement depth.
- **Content creation rate**: volume and quality of user-generated content.
- **Community growth**: how referral missions translate into new member acquisition.
- **Engagement depth**: whether users diversify their contributions across different activity types or concentrate on a single behavior.

> These scenarios demonstrate the **combinatorial power** of AWorld Lab's *gamification* features. The same building blocks — activities, Learning Paths, missions, virtual currencies, reward rules, leaderboards, and streaks — can be assembled into radically different engagement programs.
