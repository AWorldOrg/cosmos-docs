## Education Platform

An education provider wants to deliver structured courses with clear progression, assessments, and certifications — turning learning into a measurable and motivating experience for students.

### Content setup

Each course is built as a **Learning Path** with one Learning Group per chapter. Within each group, **slides** deliver the lesson content and **quizzes** assess understanding. The platform's origin model allows mixing approaches:

- **Catalog content** for foundational topics where validated, ready-to-use material accelerates deployment.
- **Custom content** for specialized subjects unique to the institution.
- **AI-generated content** for supplementary material and practice quizzes.

**Custom completion rules** enforce academic standards: a Learning Path is considered complete only when the student passes at least 80% of its quizzes. **Visibility controls** create prerequisite chains — the advanced course remains locked until the foundational course is completed, using unlock rules that trigger automatically.

### Engagement mechanics

**Missions** map to academic goals: "Complete all modules in Course X" represents the path to certification. Each mission tracks Learning Path completion as its progress metric.

A **virtual currency** — **study points** — tracks academic progression. **Reward rules** award points for quiz performance, with bonus points for perfect scores. This creates a granular measure of effort and achievement beyond simple pass/fail.

### Competitive layer

**Leaderboards scoped by class or course** let students see how they rank among their peers, motivating effort without creating anxiety across unrelated groups.

A **weekly streak** encourages regular study habits: students must engage with the platform at least 3 days per week to maintain their streak. **Perfect Week** recognition rewards students who study every day, and progressive streak goals (7 days, 30 days, 100 days) unlock achievement badges.

**Badges** serve as digital **certifications** — visible proof of course completion that students can showcase.

### Measurement

The platform provides:

- **Completion rate per course**: identifies which courses have the highest and lowest completion.
- **Average completion time**: reveals whether course length is appropriate.
- **Quiz difficulty analysis**: pinpoints which assessments are too easy or too hard based on pass rates.
- **Drop-off points**: Learning Path logs show exactly where students disengage, enabling targeted content improvements.
