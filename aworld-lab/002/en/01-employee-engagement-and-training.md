AWorld Lab's *gamification* features are designed to work together, combining content, goals, rewards, and competitive mechanics into cohesive engagement programs. This section presents four scenarios that illustrate how the platform's capabilities can be assembled to address different business contexts. Each scenario is a blueprint that clients can adapt to their specific needs.

A company with over 1,000 employees wants to build a structured onboarding program for new hires and an ongoing training initiative to keep the workforce engaged and up to date.

### Content setup

The company creates **4 to 6 Learning Paths** covering onboarding topics: company policies, internal tools, team culture, and role-specific training. Each Learning Path is organized into Learning Groups containing slides with informational content and quizzes to reinforce key concepts.

For ongoing training, the company uses AWorld Lab's **AI content generation** to produce monthly Learning Paths on emerging topics — such as new compliance requirements or product updates — without requiring dedicated editorial resources. The **catalog** provides a ready-to-use library of quizzes on general business topics, supplementing custom content.

### Engagement mechanics

Two types of **missions** drive participation:

- An **individual mission** with a 30-day range: "Complete all onboarding Learning Paths within your first month." Progress is tracked automatically as each Learning Path is finished.
- **Recurring weekly missions** for ongoing training: "Complete at least one Learning Path this week." These reset every Monday, creating a steady engagement rhythm.

The company configures **two virtual currencies**:

- **Experience points (XP)**: credited automatically for every quiz passed and every Learning Path completed. XP drives leaderboard rankings and level progression.
- **Credits**: awarded upon mission completion and redeemable for corporate rewards such as gift cards, extra time off, or branded merchandise.

**Reward rules** automate the distribution: 10 XP per quiz passed, 50 XP per Learning Path completed, and 200 credits per mission completed. A bonus reward rule grants double credits for missions completed ahead of schedule.

### Competitive layer

A **weekly leaderboard** scoped by department tag encourages friendly competition among peers. Each department sees its own ranking, fostering team spirit without discouraging newcomers who would be lost in a global ranking.

A **daily streak** rewards consistent participation: employees who engage with the platform every working day build a streak that unlocks progressive badges (7-day, 30-day, 90-day). The **freeze mechanism** lets employees spend credits to preserve their streak during vacations or busy periods.

**Levels** tied to XP accumulation provide visible progression milestones, giving employees a clear sense of advancement.

### Measurement

The company tracks:

- **Onboarding completion rate**: percentage of new hires who finish all Learning Paths within 30 days.
- **Engagement by department**: leaderboard data reveals which teams are most active, helping HR identify areas that need attention.
- **Quiz pass rate**: highlights which topics require better training materials.
- **Streak retention**: measures how consistently employees return to the platform over time.
