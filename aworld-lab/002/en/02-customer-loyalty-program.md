## Customer Loyalty Program

A consumer brand with a mobile app wants to transform its loyalty program from a passive point-collection system into an interactive engagement experience that drives repeat purchases and brand affinity.

### Content setup

The brand defines **custom activities** that track key customer behaviors through Server-to-Server integration: purchases, product reviews, social media shares, and referrals. Each event is logged as an activity, feeding directly into the *gamification* system.

Short **Learning Paths** provide product education — new collection previews, sustainability stories, or usage tips — combining slides with quizzes that test brand knowledge. These serve a dual purpose: educating customers while generating trackable engagement.

### Engagement mechanics

**Missions** create clear goals for customers:

- Threshold missions: "Make 5 purchases this month" or "Write 3 product reviews this quarter."
- **Recurring monthly missions** that reset automatically, keeping the program fresh without manual management.

A single **virtual currency** — **loyalty credits** — serves as the program's economy. Credits are earned through activity completion and mission achievement, and can be redeemed for discounts, exclusive products, or experiences.

**Reward rules** use dynamic expressions to create engaging incentives: the more a customer engages, the higher the reward per action. For example, the first purchase of the month earns 50 credits, but the fifth earns 150 — encouraging repeat behavior.

### Competitive layer

A **monthly global leaderboard** showcases the most active customers, with the top participants earning exclusive rewards at month's end. A **weekly leaderboard segmented by customer tier** (using tags such as Gold, Silver, and Bronze) ensures that customers compete with peers at a similar engagement level, keeping the competition motivating across all segments.

**Badges** mark meaningful milestones: first purchase, 50th purchase, first review, first referral. These visible recognitions encourage customers to explore different types of engagement beyond just purchasing.

### Measurement

Key metrics include:

- **Purchase frequency**: how mission structures affect buying behavior.
- **Redemption rate**: which rewards drive the highest engagement.
- **Retention rate**: whether gamified loyalty keeps customers active longer than traditional programs.
- **Cross-engagement**: whether customers who complete Learning Paths also increase their purchase frequency.
